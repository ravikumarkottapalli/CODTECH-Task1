Overview of the Project
Project: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Car Price Analysis
Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car price dataset to uncover insights that can help in understanding the factors influencing car prices. 
This includes identifying patterns, relationships, and key variables that impact the pricing of cars.
The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven insights that could be useful for businesses in pricing strategies, customer behavior analysis, or predicting car prices.

Key Activities:

1.Data Loading & Inspection:
Import the dataset using Pandas.
Conduct an initial review of the dataset to understand its structure, shape, and key features (columns, data types, missing values).

2.Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, duplicate entries, or inconsistencies in the data.
Address outliers that may distort the analysis.

3.Data Exploration:
Generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to get a sense of the distribution of the data.
Visualize key variables using histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to explore relationships between variables like car age, mileage, brand, and price.

4.Correlation Analysis:
Compute correlation matrices to identify relationships between car price and other numerical features like mileage, engine power, etc.
Use heatmaps to visually represent correlations.

5.Feature Analysis:
Explore categorical variables (e.g., car brand, fuel type) using bar charts and count plots.
Investigate how these categorical features impact car prices.

6.Insights & Recommendations:
Summarize the key findings and insights from the EDA, focusing on which factors most significantly affect car prices.
Provide recommendations for further analysis or model building (e.g., feature selection for predictive models).

Technologies Used:

1.Programming Language:
  Python: The core language used for analysis and data manipulation.

2.Libraries:
  Pandas: For data handling and manipulation, such as loading datasets, cleaning, and summarizing data.
  NumPy: For numerical operations, often used for managing arrays and numerical data.
  Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).
  Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, it's used for creating more sophisticated and informative statistical graphics like heatmaps and pairplots.
